# Slaxophone
Play pictionary-telephone on Slack!

Start a game from Slack with a slash command (/slaxophone) followed by a sentence. The next user receives a DM from slaxophone-bot that includes a prompt to illustrate the original sentence. That user responds to slaxophone-bot's prompt by uploading an image.

And so on as the sentence morphs from "An alien landed on the moon" to "I'm fat Santa" with pictionary-like drawings in between.
